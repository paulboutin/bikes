**T**he theme of this bike is in its name. "Akuma" meaning Evil spirit or Daemon. The handlebars with the reverse levers as horns, the red engine as the blood red heart the coiled exhaust as the daemons twin tails, the raw frame as the bones. The color scheme is fitting with earth tones and red and blue, the minimal accents of chrome and even the burnt wood tail-light add to its ominous demeanor. The hand painted daemon artwork and the Japanese name bring it all together. Akuma 悪魔.

**T**his Gen 2 XV had a rough beginning. When it was acquired it was a non runner with a bad rotor and stater. There were lots of missing parts and a parts box full of Xv parts from a Gen 1 model. There was little direction or inspiration to get this build off the ground. The first goal was to get it running and fix the issues it had with the charging system. After sitting for quite some time in the garage and staring at it for months the bike wanted to be a bobber. The tail end was already cut by the previous owner and something had to be done with it. The gas tank was purchased to complement the engine and give the bike a new line. The tank is from a 2016 Indian Scout with fuel injection with the gas pump built into the tank.

**T**he tank was striped to bare metal and plates were added to the front to reshape the tunnel to better fit the frame of the XV. Tank mounts were made on the frame to fit the mounts on the tank. The tank was then hand painted with blue and red on a neutral background. It was scuffed and rusted to create the distressed patina then coated with clear to seal it all in. A fuel regulator keeps the fuel pump pressure low enough to run a set of CV carbs.

**T**he frame's rear section was modified to flatten out the upswept factory line and lowered 2 1/2 inches. It was then hand stripped with a wire wheel and cleaned up. The welds were accented and the frame was clear coated. 10 1/2 inch DNM shocks complete the line of the frame.

**U**p front, 1 inch drag bars were installed with a set of reverse levers and Vans grips. The stock gauges were removed and a new smaller speedometer was added just inside the riders left knee. The brake master cylinder and reservoir were relocated below the neck of the frame and cover up the ignition coils. Small discreet switches were added for the left bar controls.

A new old school harley headlight bucket was used with a new halo style LED to keep things bright. The factory air-box was removed and a new one was built using the factory boot and fitted with a K&N filter.

**S**tainless exhaust tips complete the look of the wild curves of the daemon tail exhaust. It was pieced together with pie cuts of various degrees and wrapped in titanium exhaust wrap. The engine was painted two tone black and red to accent the tanks colors and theme.

**T**he seat complements the look and finishes the lines of the bike. On top of the rear fender is mounted a wooden clamshell LED light fixture. It was treated with Shou Sugi Ban (Japanese wood treatment by process of sealing the wood by burning)
