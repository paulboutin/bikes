Right from the start Paul had a vision for this build. The GL is not a very forgiving platform as the CX, with the bulky frame but that was a challenge Paul was not afraid to tackle. Taking inspiration from Sacha Lakic's "BT-01" and Ugly Motors "Black Beauty". Paul has crafted a perfect blend of style and performance enhancements with this build.

With Yamaha GSX-R 1000 front forks and Honda CBR954 RR rear mono shock, the handling of this machine got a huge upgrade from stock and the bike was given a more aggressive stance. Paul paid close attention to be sure that the geometry was just right.

The frame was cleaned up to knock off the ugly, seam welds and side panel mounting holes. The rear sub-frame was re-imagined with simple lines and upswept tail. The tank paint features a subtle skull hidden in the matt stripe going down the center that disappears is certain light.

Upfront the bars and instrument cluster were cleaned up with new clip-on bars, Koso gauges and a custom integration of a slim and modern LED headlight tucked in tight and close.

Shorty mufflers on the stock exhaust headers keeps the look clean while providing adequate flow and exhaust note. Complementing the stance, Slip Steam Cycle rear-sets were custom fitted to the GL frame to bring the seating position back making the transition to clip-on bars more comfortable.

The hump in the seat hides all the electrics with a Lithium Ion battery and an M-unit. The need for a key was removed all together with the use of the M-unit Blue and the ignition was converted to electronic with a Ray-san's hall effect setup for more performance an no more need for igniters.
