### My Story
Sometime around 2016, having seen lots of custom bikes on social media, inspiration struck me and by the end of the year a donor bike was obtained. Drawing from those inspirations there was a picture in my head of what it was to become, but had little idea on where to start. This is not to say that I didn't have any experience with this kind of thing, but it had been a long time since any major work or repairs had been done by me on my own vehicles, other than the simple oil change. 

With a father who always did his own repairs, I had exposure to his workshop and tools from a young age. He would often find me taking apart my toys to see how they would work, repairing them or modifying them to make something comply different. At the age of 15 I was already fixing, repairing and modifying my own cars. 

Even with the few tools I had, the bike was striped down in no time. There was an empty frame and a pile of parts, one pile for keeps and another for discards. This is where most projects fail, the project seems overwhelming and you realize you're in over your head, but with determination I pressed on. Armed with a grinder and a welder the bike began to take shape. 

That first build seemed to drag out, having doubts and reworking things over and over because some aspect was missed or something just didn't feel right. It took 4 years to complete the build after starting over a few times, taking long brakes to save money for the next part purchase or life just got in the way. But as things go, when a project ends theres now something missing, the desire to keep building and creating. 

Now living in Arizona with an art and engineering background, I'm working on new builds, trying new things and pushing myself creatively. I enjoy my time in the garage building bikes, working with electronics, wiring or generally being creative. I'm always striving to level up, learn new things and continue to improve my fabrication skills.
