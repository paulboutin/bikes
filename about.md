### My Story
Sometime around 2016, having seen lots of custom bikes on social media, inspiration struck me and by the end of the year a donor bike was obtained. Drawing from those inspirations there was a picture in my head of what it was to become, but had little idea on where to start. This is not to say that I didn't have any experience with this kind of thing, but it had been a long time since any major work or repairs had been done by me on my own vehicles, other than the simple oil change. 

With a father who always did his own repairs, I had exposure to his workshop and tools from a young age. He would often find me taking apart my toys to see how they would work, repairing them or modifying them to make something comply different. At the age of 15 I was already fixing, repairing and modifying my own cars. 

With a few tools and desire to learn, the bike was striped down in no time. This is where most projects fail, the task gets daunting and overwhelming or you realize your in over your head. Filled with determination and pressing on, ideas were forming and new tools were being purchased and the build began to take shape. 

That first build always seems to drag out, having doubts and reworking things over and over because some aspect was missed or something just didn't feel right. It took 4 years to complete the build after starting over a few times, taking long brakes to save money for the next part purchase. But as things go, when a project ends theres now something missing, the desire to keep building and creating. 

Now living in Arizona with an art and engineering background, I enjoy working with electronics, wiring and building bikes. I'm always pushing myself to learn new things and continue to improve my fabrication skills.
